This repository is intended for developing as many clang-tidy checks as possible for MISRA C 2023 and MISRA C 2012.

Invoke these temporary scripts to build Clang-Tidy with MISRA support:
1. ./setup.sh
2. ./configure.sh
3. ./build.sh

The assumed compiler version is Clang 19

Note: The temporary scripts needs to be changed to a docker container in the future but that is on the TODO list.
